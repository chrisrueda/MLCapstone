# MLCapstone
This repository contains materials for the Machine Learning Capstone course offered by IBM.
About this Course

The Machine Learning Capstone course leverages various Python-based machine learning libraries, including Pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras. It serves as a culmination of your machine learning journey, allowing you to apply and demonstrate your proficiency in the field.

Before enrolling in this course, it is essential to complete all preceding courses within the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate program.

Throughout this capstone, participants will:

    Build a course recommender system
    Analyze course-related datasets
    Calculate cosine similarity and create a similarity matrix
    Generate recommendation systems using techniques such as KNN, PCA, and non-negative matrix collaborative filtering

Additionally, participants will have the opportunity to share their work with peers for evaluation, fostering a collaborative learning experience.
